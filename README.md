**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

The most important part of creating a product is how it meets the client’s needs. If you can’t take what a client wants to see, figure out how that should be presented for the user and build the product around these needs, then you are not able to deliver an appropriate product to the client. Take the SNHU Travel project, the client gave their needs, which were to have a niche vacation booking system and this booking system should provide a service which allows users to book niche and top travel destinations. After this the Product Owner and Scrum Master met with a focus group to collect additional information about what users would want to see in this type of product. From there, with both the client needs and user needs in mind we created the user stories. User stories allow the team to visualize what the answer to a given need should look like. For example, one user need was to see a list of 5 to 10 top travel destinations. From this need we build the user story, “as a user I want to be able to go to the SNHU Travel booking page and see a list of 5 to 10 top travel destinations”. This is essentially a way to re-word the stated need into a set of criteria. The user needs to a) be able to go to the SNHU Travel website, then b) open the booking system page, and c) be shown a list of top travel destinations. This is a more clear outline of what the answering task needs to accomplish and even sets the beginning acceptance criteria for testing later on.


**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

After completing this course I approach developing programs differently. I was not aware of Scrum or Kanban or any of these frameworks. I had seen Agile listed in a few job descriptions but I just thought it was another programming language! Of course, I understand now what these concepts really are. I hope to work in a Scrum framework at some point, because I would like to experience what a real world Scrum team is like, and I would like to experience other frameworks as well so I can figure out which one I work best in. I like to practice programming by giving myself little prompts and seeing how much I am able to achieve on my own and comparing how my code looks with more professional work. I think I will start incorporating some Scrum methods into this practice so that I can get as familiar with it as I can!


**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

I think the most important thing to remember as a team member in software development is flexibility. Now more than ever it seems that software developers are expected to have a grasp of multiple programming languages and database languages, at least based on the jobs I have looked into. You have to be able to do many things, wear many hats, in order to accomplish large scale tasks, so this is something I will keep in mind as I continue learning about software development!
